suffix: pre-release, debug, snapshot, development, release, release-candidate

I want to include date and time. Additionally a little comment string, less than 10 characters.

The API needs to be documented for this system to work.

Additionally github makes a versioning system less important for beginners.

Actually Gradle seems to be best for this purpose.

Still, I should use my own system, and learn to store that little incrementing number myself...


gradle script:
android {
    defaultConfig {
        buildConfigField "long", "TIMESTAMP", System.currentTimeMillis() + "L"
    }
}
 */
